## Shoelaces

The point of this question is **NOT** to provide a number. The point is to observe the process the interviewee takes to approximate a response. The interviewee will provide factors that need to be considered if they were to calculate an actual numeric response.

### How many shoelaces are there in Canada?

## Solution



## Alternatives

I have often had students returnt o campus and express that they received the **shoelace** question in a job interview. This questions has many forms, but the principle is the same:
