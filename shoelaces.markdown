## Shoelaces

The point of this question is **NOT** to provide a number. The point is to observe the process the interviewee takes to approximate a response. The interviewee will provide factors that need to be considered if they were to calculate an actual numeric response.

### How many shoelaces are there in Canada?

## Solution

<details>

<summary>
A potential solution would include the following considerations:
</summary>

<ul>
<li>The population of Canada</li>
<li>Shoes have two laces</li>
</ul>

Often interviewees will stop after stating these two facts, a good answer could include the following:

<ul>
<li>People have more than one pari of shoes</li>
<li>Some shoes do not have laces</li>
<li>There are shoes in stores and factories</li>
<li>There are laces not yet in shoes</li>
</ul>

And some more advanced additions:

<ul>
<li>Ther are lots of shoelaces in the garbage dump</li>
<li>There are shoelaces in skates and rollerblades</li>
</ul>

## Alternatives

I have often had students return to campus and express that they received the **shoelace** question in a job interview. This questions has many forms, but the principle is the same:

### How many loaves of bread are there in Canada?

### How many tires are there in Canada?
